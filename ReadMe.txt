Euterpea is a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for 
computer music research, education, and development, providing 
both note-level and signal-level abstractions.  It is a descendant 
of Haskore and HasSound, and is intended for both educational purposes 
as well as serious computer music applications.  Euterpea is a 
wide-spectrum DSL, suitable for high-level music representation, 
algorithmic composition, and analysis; mid-level concepts such as 
MIDI; and low-level audio processing, sound synthesis, and instrument 
design.
